Description: Grid Analysis and Display System for earth science data
 The Grid Analysis and Display System (GrADS) is an interactive desktop tool
 that is used for easy access, manipulation, and visualization of earth 
 science data. The format of the data may be either binary, GRIB, NetCDF, or 
 HDF-SDS (Scientific Data Sets). GrADS has been implemented worldwide on 
 a variety of commonly used operating systems and is freely distributed 
 over the Internet.
 .
 GrADS uses a 4-Dimensional data environment: longitude, latitude, 
 vertical level, and time. Data sets are placed within the 4-D space 
 by use of a data descriptor file. GrADS interprets station data as well as
 gridded data, and the grids may be regular, non-linearly spaced, gaussian, or
 of variable resolution. Data from different data sets may be graphically 
 overlaid, with correct spatial and time registration. Operations are executed
 interactively by entering FORTRAN-like expressions at the command line. 
 A rich set of built-in functions are provided, but users may also add their 
 own functions as external routines written in any programming language.
 .
 Data may be displayed using a variety of graphical techniques: line and 
 bar graphs, scatter plots, smoothed contours, shaded contours, streamlines, 
 wind vectors, grid boxes, shaded grid boxes, and station model plots. 
 Graphics may be output in PostScript or image formats. GrADS provides 
 geophysically intuitive defaults, but the user has the option to control 
 all aspects of graphics output.
 .
 GrADS has a programmable interface (scripting language) that allows for 
 sophisticated analysis and display applications. Use scripts to display 
 buttons and dropmenus as well as graphics, and then take action based on user 
 point-and-clicks. GrADS can be run in batch mode, and the scripting language
 facilitates using GrADS to do long overnight batch jobs.
