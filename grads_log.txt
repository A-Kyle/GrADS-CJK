hdf5:
    sudo apt-get install libhdf5-dev
    if ./configure fails check for H5fopen in -lhdf5,
      link libhdf5.a, libhdf5.so (etc.) lib files from wherever they were installed 
      to /usr/lib/ or some other directory that the configure script can find the 
      hdf5 libraries 
      e.g., your hdf5 libs may be located in /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/hdf5/serial/
      if you don't know where hdf5 was installed, try:
        whereis hdf5
      or:        
        dpkg --listfiles libhdf5-dev
      Similarly, you may need to link the include files from hdf5
      from wherever they were put to /usr/include/hdf5/
      (e.g., my include files were placed in /usr/include/hdf5/serial/, so
      I linked to them in /usr/include/hdf5/)


udunits:
    sudo apt-add-repository universe
    sudo apt-get install libudunits2-dev
    link libudunits2 .a, .so, etc. files to /usr/lib/, rename as libudunits (no ending 2)

libpng15: 
    download tarball, unpack, make, make install
    make sure that your configuration can find the libpng libraries
      you may need to move the libpng(15) files to /usr/lib or somewhere
      similar

libjasper:
    sudo add-apt-repository "deb http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu xenial-security main"
    sudo apt update
      (this will likely require adding authentication keys to apt-key or whatever replaces it)
    sudo apt install libjasper-dev

modify environment:
    export PKG_CONFIG="/usr/bin/pkg-config"
    export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/pkgconfig/"
    export GAUDPT="<grads directory>/udpt" --> create the udpt file
    export GADDIR="<grads directory>/data"
